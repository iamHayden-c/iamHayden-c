### Hello, I'm Hayden! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an isogram word guessing game in the Unreal Engine (UE4) utilizing C++

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning front end languages such as JavaScript, JQuery, React, and Node.js. Beyond C++ I am also beginning in Python with the Django framework.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™d be open for help with a Spring Maven project I began (repo: https://github.com/iamHayden-c/MARS ) where the JS and CSS target files do not serve up to the browser with the static content.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my interest in music and world wide traveling!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm learning German as a second language!
